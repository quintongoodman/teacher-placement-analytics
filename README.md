# Teacher Placement Analytics â€“ SQL Portfolio Project

This repository contains a fictional teacher placement dataset and a set of SQL queries to demonstrate practical data analysis and reporting skills commonly used by data analysts in higher education.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Designed a relational database schema for students, schools, mentors, supervisors, and placements.
- Wrote **12 SQL queries** showcasing:
  - Multi-table `JOIN`s
  - Aggregations with `GROUP BY`
  - Conditional logic with `CASE`
  - Subqueries for advanced filtering
  - Window functions (`RANK()`, `PARTITION BY`)
