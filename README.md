# Teacher Placement Analytics â€“ SQL Portfolio Project

This repository contains a fictional teacher placement dataset and a set of SQL queries to demonstrate practical data analysis and reporting skills commonly used by data analysts in higher education.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Designed a relational database schema for students, schools, mentors, supervisors, and placements.
- Wrote **12 SQL queries** showcasing:
  - Multi-table `JOIN`s
  - Aggregations with `GROUP BY`
  - Conditional logic with `CASE`
  - Subqueries for advanced filtering
  - Window functions (`RANK()`, `PARTITION BY`)

## ðŸ“Š Skills Demonstrated
- Writing efficient SQL for data analysis and reporting
- Designing relational schemas
- Using conditional logic with `CASE`
- Writing subqueries for dynamic filtering
- Applying window functions for ranking and analytics

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- John Carter supervised the most students (2 placements), while other mentors supervised only 1 student each.
- Maple Grove Elementary had the highest average final evaluation score (95.0).
- Students in Secondary Math had the highest average GPA (3.8), while Special Education students had the lowest (3.2).

## ðŸªž Reflection
This project strengthened my SQL skills beyond basic SELECT statements. I became more confident using JOINs, GROUP BY, CASE statements, subqueries, and window functions to answer real-world business questions. It also reinforced the importance of designing a clean relational schema before writing queries. Creating this fictional dataset allowed me to simulate realistic reporting tasks similar to my current role in higher education while producing a portfolio-ready project.
